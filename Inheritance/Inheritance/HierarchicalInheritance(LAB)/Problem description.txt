                Hierarchical Inheritance

Create three classes named Animal, Dog and Cat.
Animal with a single public method Eat() that prints: &quot;eating…&quot;
Dog with a single public method Bark() that prints: &quot;barking…&quot;
Cat with a single public method Meow() that prints: &quot;meowing…&quot;
Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal.
