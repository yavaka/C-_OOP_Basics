                Encapsulation

1. Encapsulation (Hiding implementation) : 
Process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
    1.1. Class fields must be private.
    1.2. Use getters and setters to access data.

2. Keyword this : 
    2.1. This is reference to the current object.
    2.2. This refers to the current instance of the class.
    2.3. This can be passed as a parameter to other methods.
    2.4. This can be returned from method.
    2.5. This can invoke current class methods.
    2.6. This can be used for constructor overloading

3. Access modifiers :

    3.1. Private modifier : 
        * Main way to perform encapsulation and hide data from the outside world.
        * Private is the default modifier.
    
    3.2. Protected modifier : 
        * Can only be accessed by inherited classes.
        * Avoid declaring protected classes. 

    3.3. Internal modifier : 
        * Internal is default class modifier in C#.
        * Accessible to any other classes in a project.




4. State validation :

5. Mutable and immutable objects :
