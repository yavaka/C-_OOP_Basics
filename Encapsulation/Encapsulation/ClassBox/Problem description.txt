        Class Box
You are given a geometric figure box with parameters length, width and height. Model a class Box that that can be
instantiated by the same three parameters. Expose to the outside world only methods for its surface area, lateral
surface area and its volume (formulas: http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm).
On the first three lines you will get the length, width and height. On the next three lines print the surface area,
lateral surface area and the volume of the box:
